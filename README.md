Airline Management System
This is a Java-based Airline Management System developed using Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), JDBC for database connectivity, and Java for core logic. 
The project is designed to simplify the management of airline operations, including flight scheduling, booking, and passenger management. 
It provides an intuitive user interface to facilitate tasks such as booking flights, managing flight details, and viewing passenger information

Features:
Flight Management: Admin can add, update, or remove flights, including flight number, destination, date, and available seats.
Passenger Management: Manage passenger details, including booking, viewing, and canceling reservations.
Booking System: Users can search for available flights based on destination and dates, and make bookings.
User Authentication: Role-based access for different users (Admin, Staff, and Customer) to ensure proper access control.
Database Integration: Uses JDBC for connecting to a relational database to store and manage data such as flight details, reservations, and passenger records.
Search & Filter Options: Users can search for flights by destination, date, and other criteria.

Technologies Used:
Java: Core programming language for building the application.
Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
JDBC: For interacting with the database (CRUD operations).
MySQL (or other database): Relational database to store flight and passenger data.
